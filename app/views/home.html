          <strong>What is this?</strong> MiniVan, as "mini visual analyser of networks", is an online tool for publishing and exploring networks. It is currently in <strong>public alpha</strong>, which means that you can test it and share this URL, but that you should <strong>expect all your published networks to become unavailable when the beta version is released (on November 30th, 2019) </strong>. Do not hesitate to get in touch with us through Github and file issues for any bug you may encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
          A video tutorial for the tool will be published by the end of this month.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to use.</strong> You can upload a GEXF network in an interface named "Maker" and tune publication settings. You will get a "data bundle" containing your network, its metadata (title, description...) and publication settings. You need to host this bundle somewhere online, for instance on GitHub. You then have to pass the data bundle's URL to MiniVan, in order to explore your network.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Demo networks.</strong> Look at how it looks like:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#!/explorer?bundle=data%2Ftest00.json">Test network 00 - Rio +20 - Nodes attributes</a></li>
            <li><a href="#!/explorer?bundle=data%2Ftest01.json">Test network 01 - Nordic Design - Encoding stuff</a></li>
            <li><a href="#!/explorer?bundle=data%2Ftest02.json">Test network 02 - School - Edge attributes</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. <a href="#!/maker">MiniVan Maker</a>.</strong> Upload a GEXF network, tune settings, get a data bundle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. <a href="#!/start">Get the URL</a>.</strong> Give your data bundle's URL, get a MiniVan URL. You need to host the data bundle somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Explore your network.</strong> Get the URL on step 2, or try a <a href="#!/?bundle=data%2Ftest00.json">demo network</a>.
